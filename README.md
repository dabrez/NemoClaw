# OpenShell Plugin — OpenClaw Plugin for OpenShell

Migrate and run OpenClaw inside OpenShell with optional NIM-backed inference.

## Architecture

```
openshell-plugin/                # Thin TypeScript plugin (runs in-process with OpenClaw gateway)
  src/
    index.ts                 # Plugin entry: registers all openshell commands
    commands/                # UX layer: argument handling, progress, guardrails
      launch.ts              # Fresh install (prefers OpenShell-native for net-new users)
      migrate.ts             # Primary value: migrate host OpenClaw into sandbox
      connect.ts             # Interactive shell into sandbox
      status.ts              # Blueprint run state + sandbox health
      logs.ts                # Stream logs from blueprint/sandbox/inference
      eject.ts               # Rollback to host installation from snapshot
    blueprint/               # Blueprint resolution + execution
      resolve.ts             # Version resolution, cache management
      verify.ts              # Digest verification, compatibility checks
      exec.ts                # Subprocess execution of blueprint runner
      state.ts               # Persistent state (run IDs, snapshots)

openshell-blueprint/             # Versioned blueprint artifact (separate release stream)
  blueprint.yaml             # Manifest: version, profiles, compatibility
  orchestrator/
    runner.py                # CLI runner: plan/apply/status/rollback
  policies/
    openclaw-sandbox.yaml    # Conservative static baseline policy
  migrations/
    snapshot.py              # Snapshot/restore/cutover/rollback logic
  iac/                       # (future) Declarative infrastructure modules
```

## Quick Start

### For existing OpenClaw users (primary path)

```bash
openclaw plugins install ./openshell-plugin
openclaw openshell migrate --profile ollama
openclaw openshell connect
```

### For net-new users (OpenShell-native preferred)

```bash
openshell sandbox create --from openclaw --name openclaw
openshell sandbox connect openclaw
```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `openclaw openshell launch` | Fresh install into OpenShell (warns net-new users) |
| `openclaw openshell migrate` | Migrate host OpenClaw into sandbox (snapshot + cutover) |
| `openclaw openshell connect` | Interactive shell into the sandbox |
| `openclaw openshell status` | Blueprint state, sandbox health, inference config |
| `openclaw openshell logs` | Stream logs (sandbox, blueprint, inference) |
| `openclaw openshell eject` | Rollback to host installation from snapshot |

## Inference Profiles

| Profile | Provider | Model | Use Case |
|---------|----------|-------|----------|
| `default` | NVIDIA cloud | nemotron-3-super | Production, requires API key |
| `nim-local` | Local NIM service | nemotron-3-super | On-prem, NIM deployed as pod |
| `ollama` | Ollama | llama3.1:8b | Local development, no API key |

## Design Principles

1. **Thin plugin, versioned blueprint** — Plugin stays small and stable; orchestration logic evolves independently
2. **Respect CLI boundaries** — Plugin commands live under `openshell` namespace, never override built-in OpenClaw commands
3. **Supply chain safety** — Immutable versioned artifacts with digest verification
4. **OpenShell-native for net-new** — Don't force double-install; prefer `openshell sandbox create`
5. **Snapshot everything** — Every migration creates a restorable backup
